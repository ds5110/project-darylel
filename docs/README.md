## Words Matter
A word may only be spoken once or twice during a lengthy conversation. Oftentimes this results in the word being disregarded. Words that are spoken the least during a conversation, however, may be critical to understanding the subtext or underlying tone of a conversation. This is even more powerful when looking at these less spoken words all together within the context of a conversation. This method used in this project looked at both the words that were spoken the most during a conversation and words that were spoken less often. The analysis of the two different methods side by side in some cases demonstrates what was stated previously -- the less spoken words can paint a very different picture of the conversation that took place. As an example, below is the analysis of Somerset County, which is a rural, northern county in Maine.

The analysis on the left of the most common words shows words that would be expected in a conversation about education. The analysis on the right of the least common words shows the struggles that the community is experiencing and its impact on education. The words include: pregnant, anxiety, divorce, tension [OTHER WORDS TO HIGHLIGHT AND ADD?].
